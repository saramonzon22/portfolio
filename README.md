# Portfolio
## Hello to all of you!

Here is my portfolio. Treat him well, say nice things to him, love him like I love him, ok? :blush:

I've developed it with React & Sass. In it you can find four sections. Let's see them! :eyes:

### Home :star:

Here is a small presentation and a card with my skills. As if it was my role character card!

### Who :girl:

This section is dedicated to get to know me a little bit better, where I come from, what I studied, where I'm going.

### Projects :runner:

A list of all the projects I developed during my studies at Adalab. They are differentiated by personal and group projects. If you go over them, they will light up. If you click on them you will be taken to the page of that project. 


### RRSS :sparkles:

This section is the simplest in terms of design, it is a section in case you want to contact me through my social networks or if you liked it so much that you want to see my LinkedIn and send me a job application! I listen to offers. 

### Notes :speech_balloon:

As always, any error or suggestion you see to improve it, is welcome. Don't hesitate to write me.

Best regards, 
Sara
